# Congitive Baises 

## Confirmation bias: 
People who believe the claim might be more likely to contribute examples that confirm it. People who doubt the claim are more likely to cite counterexamples.

## Confidence Bias
People are biased towards people who are confident. This in no way answers the question if they are capable.For example in job interviews, it is difficult for the interviewer to answer the hard question if the person is capable so they unknowingly subsidtute the easy question concering if the person is confident instead.   

## Halo Effect 
People tend to be less critical of someone they support and more critical of someone they don't. For examples in political elections, your guys is a saint that can do no wrong whereas the opposition is the devil. 

## Planning Bias
Planning out a a tasks is easy, actually doing the task is hard.  

## Anchoring Effect 
Numbers act as an anchor, especally in situation in which a person does not have enough information to make a informated decision. For example, was Gandhi more than 100 years old when he died? How old was he?
