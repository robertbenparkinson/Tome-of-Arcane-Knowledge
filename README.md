# Tome-of-Arcane-Knowledge
Welcome to the Tome of Arcane Knowledge.

Here is where I keep my coding, programming and other notes.

I am in the process of adding all the cool Drupal, PHP, Python, and all the cool Data Science related code I've put together over the last year while working on Ovr.  

Please have a look!

Thanks,

Ben
